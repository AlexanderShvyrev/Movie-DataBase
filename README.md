This is an interactive web application that allows users to search, add, and discuss movies. I’ve integrated Google API so that users can look up the nearest movie theater. I’ve also built a login and registration for the app.	

Tools Used: ASP.Net Core, Entity Framework, MySQL, C#, MVC, OOP, ORM, LINQ	

You'll have to get your own api key in order to have google maps working
